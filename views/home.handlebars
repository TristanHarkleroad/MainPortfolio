      <div class="a">
      <p> My name is Tristan Harkleroad and I am currently a student in the Georgia Tech Coding <br>
        Bootcamp. I was born and raised in Savannah, Georgia and currently live in Midway, Georgia.<br>
        I graduated from Benedictine Military School in 2014 and went on to graduate from the Citadel <br>
        in 2018. I discovered my passion for computer coding and programming when I was a second <br>
        semester senior in college. Once I figured it out, I started researching and learning about coding.<br>
        My brother told me about this coding bootcamp for Georgia Tech and I looked into it. <br> And here I am! </p>

      <p> My hobbies consist of competitive gaming, Netflix, writing code, and reading. I love to watch<br>
         Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, The Office, and Marvel movies. I enjoy learning new things  <br>
         and  keeping up with new technology being developed and how it improved from past versions.  <br>
         I am pretty open to anyone and I am very easy to get along with too. I hope you enjoy my first website!</p>
