    <p> My hobbies consist of competitive gaming, Netflix, writing code, and reading. I love to watch 
      Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, The Office, and Marvel movies. I enjoy learning new things  
      and keeping up with new technology being developed and how it improved from past versions.  
      I am pretty open to anyone and I am very easy to get along with too. I hope you enjoy my first website!</p>
